# COMP20003-Ass1
A project that implements a dictionary with binary search trees (with both standard and linked-list versions), then generates and runs tests on the search operation to determine the complexity of BSTs.

To run your own data tests:
1. Run `make test`.
2. `cd` to Testing
3. Open `jz_data.py`, and change the sizes array to include the sample sizes you would like to test.
4. Run `python jz_data.py <input_file.csv>`, where input_file is an original dataset .csv (i.e. 'athlete_events_filtered.csv').
