# COMP20003-Ass1
A project that implements a dictionary with binary search trees (with both standard and linked-list versions), then generates and runs tests on the search operation to determine the complexity of BSTs.

To run your own data tests:
1. Run 'make' or 'make debug' in the root.
2. Copy dict1 and dict2 to Inputs.
3 Run jz_data.py with any of the .csv files in Inputs.
